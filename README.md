# Crime and Income Relationship in NYC

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between crime rates and income levels in New York City (NYC). The aim is to provide insights for policymakers to better understand the dynamics of crime in relation to economic well-being.

## Motivation

Crime rates in NYC are a significant concern. This project seeks to address key questions:
- How does crime correlate with demographics and income?
- What types of crimes are prevalent in different boroughs?
- How does crime distribution change over the years?

## Data Sources

- [NYPD Complaint Data Historic](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i)
- [Income Data](https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/download#0,8/29)

## Key Observations

- Brooklyn and Manhattan have higher crime rates.
- Crime rates show a decreasing trend over the years.
- Petit Larceny and Harassment are the most common and successful crimes.
- Robbery is often caught compared to other crimes.
- Most crime suspects are between 25 and 44 years old.

## Findings

The analysis suggests a strong correlation between poverty (measured by income levels) and crime rates in NYC. Policymakers can use these findings to formulate targeted strategies for crime prevention and economic development in specific areas.

## Challenges

- Data resource availability and size.
- Normalization and standardization of data.
- Matching crime data with income data.

## How to Use

1. Review the Jupyter notebook for detailed analysis.
2. Access the provided data sources for further exploration.
3. Consider the findings for informed policymaking.
